# ðŸš€ REPOSITORY - Generative AI 

Welcome my personal generative AI project repository  designed and built from scratch to explore the power of large language models and deep learning. This repo focuses on [brief descriptionâ€”e.g., "text generation, summarization, image creation, AI Gents or chat-based AI applications"], showcasing modern AI capabilities through a hands-on implementation.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Built using [e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, PyTorch, TensorFlow]
- âœ… Implements [e.g., T5 / GPT / Stable Diffusion / BERT / etc.]
- âœ… End-to-end training + inference pipeline
- âœ… Integrated with [e.g., Streamlit / Flask / FastAPI] for real-time demo
- âœ… Optionally uses a vector store and semantic search
- âœ… Model fine-tuning on custom data
